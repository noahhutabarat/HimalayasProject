This database covers data from expedition archives of a well known journalist, Elizabeth Hawley. https://www.himalayandatabase.com/index.html\n3.2 Source data is thoroughly explained (i.e. what was the original purpose of the data, when was it collected, how many variables did the original have, explain any peculiarities of the source data such as how missing values are recorded, etc).\n3.3 Data importing and cleaning steps are explained in the text (tell me why you are doing the data cleaning activities that you perform) and follow a logical process.\n3.4 Once your data is clean, show what the final data set looks like. However, do not print more than 20 rows of your data to the screen; rather, show me the data in a condensed form (i.e. using enhanced print for tibbles, head/tail commands, etc).\n3.5 Provide summary information about the variables of concern in your cleaned data set. provide me with a consolidated explanation, either with a table that provides summary info for each variable or a nicely written summary paragraph with inline code."

There are only 43 attempts on Route 2 whereas there are 862 attempts on Route 1. Therefore, Route 1 would be the safest option as it has been attempted much more than the other routes, and it has a 72% success rate.\nRoute 1 is the most optimal route."
