# Introduction

Add your intro section here

# Packages Required

Add your required package info/code here.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # visualize graphs 
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor) # clean up data 
library(dyplyr)
```

# Data Preparation

Add info/code related to data preparation. This would be the steps you performed to clean your data, maybe creating new variables, and putting it into a convenient, tidy form for data analysis in the next step.

Are expeditions with no hired personnel (NOHIRED) associated with higher or lower death rates? Compare NOHIRED (no hired personnel) with MDEATHS (number of member deaths).

To clean first - only select rows that have total members equal to or less than number of member deaths

```{r}
deathdf <- subset(exped_tidy, 
                  select = c(TOTMEMBERS, MDEATHS, NOHIRED), 
                  TOTMEMBERS >= MDEATHS )
```

Create a new death rate column - using total number of members (TOTMEMBERS) and number of member deaths (MDEATHS)

```{r}
deathdf <- deathdf |> mutate(DRATE = MDEATHS/TOTMEMBERS)
```

Create a plot to show whether expeditions with no hired personnel (NOHIRED) are associated with higher or lower death rates?

```{r}
ggplot(deathdf, aes(x = DRATE, color = NOHIRED)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(
    #title = "Rate of death in relation to hired personnel",
    x = "Death rate") +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Present", "Absent"), 
                     values = c("darkblue", "red"),
                     name = "Hired Personnel")
```

Which mountain range (HIMAL_FACTOR) has the highest average peak height (HEIGHTM)?

```{r}
subset(peaks_tidy,
       select = c(HIMAL_FACTOR, HEIGHTM), 
       max(peaks_tidy$HEIGHTM))
```

```{r}
slice_max(subset(peaks_tidy, select = c(HIMAL_FACTOR, HEIGHTM)), order_by = HEIGHTM)
```

What is the distribution of peak heights (HEIGHTM) for peaks that are open (OPEN) versus those that are not?

```{r}
ggplot(peaks_tidy, aes(x = HEIGHTM, fill = OPEN)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    #title = "Rate of death in relation to hired personnel",
    x = "Height of peaks") +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("CLOSED", "OPEN"), 
                     values = c("blue", "orange"),
                     name = "Open for expedition")
```

```{r}

ggplot(peaks_tidy, aes(x = HIMAL_FACTOR, fill = PSTATUS_FACTOR)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(
    x = "Mountain range") +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Climbed", "Unclimbed"),
                    name = "Climbing status")
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Add info/code related to exploratory data analysis. This would be the code you used to generate visualizations and summary statistics as well as narrative text that interprets and explains interesting features in the plots/statistics you generated.

# Summary

Add your summary here.
